The project is to use  the Twitch.tv API to complete the following user stories:

1. A user can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

1. A user can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

1. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, one can see additional details about what they are streaming.
